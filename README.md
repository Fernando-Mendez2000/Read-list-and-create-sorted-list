# Read the list and create a sorted list

Fernando Isidro Mendez Class COP 2805c

We are going to create a program that is able to read a list of values, sort that list, and then output the result into a separate file. We are in 
no way tampering with the original file. We are to create a new one.
We are utilizing the Readfile command to read the directory path of the given file, and then sorting the data in an array. The sorted array will then be output to a new file with the Writefile command.
